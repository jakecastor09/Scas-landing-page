            HISTORY OF ST. CHARLES AUGUSTINE SCHOOL OF BIÑAN LAGUNA INC.
          </h3>
          <p class="about_us-page__our-story__p text-center mt-4">
            When we saw that there was a felt need to put up a Preparatory
            school in the community, we inspired to start a small school by
            using a small lot (garage) as the site of this learning center.
            Establishing a school was not so easy as there are lot of factors to
            be considered. For us, little kids who got to school in their early
            ages should have the notion that schooling is a worthwhile and happy
            experience and not a boring plain learning alone. Thus, the very
            infant Kindergarten and Nursery was named “Little Wonders Learning
            Center”. It is a school that communes with the community and it is a
            learning place where neighboring mothers and grandmothers don’t have
            to suffer a long way to travel to send their children and
            grandchildren to school away from busy streets hazards and from
            violent laden society in other words, accessibility to the school is
            favorable to the students. In 1999 with the expansion made in the
            said school, words of encouragement to change the name of the school
            have been raised by the parents concerned and staff as well. Thus,
            LWLC is now named, St. Charles Augustine School of Biñan Laguna Inc.
            with the approval of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on
            May 2, 2002. St. Charles Augustine School of Biñan Laguna Inc. is a
            non-sectarian institution owned by Reynaldo/Millette Casunuran, it
            is non-profit, non-stock institution situated at 170 Brgy. Timbao
            Biñan, Laguna. The school started its operation in the school year
            1995-1996 offering Pre-elementary education with barely 1 room with
            15 pupils enrolled in Kinder. On second year, the school opened
            complete Pre-elementary department Nursery, Kinder and Preparatory
            respectively. The population grew to 30, an indicator of community’s
            confidence with us. In the school year 1997-1998 government
            recognition was granted by the DECS for the Pre-Elementary May 21,
            1997. When the Elementary level (Grades 1-3) was opened, its
            population rose to 45. By the school year 1998-1999 when the
            Elementary was opened (Grade 1-4) the student population became 65.
            On its fifth year operation (1999-2000) the student population rose
            to 70. The legal documentation for its registration was approved by
            the DTI on September 16, 1999. Then in the school year 2000-2001
            SCAS - Pre-elementary department became fully operational.
            Government recognition was granted by the Department of Education
            for the Elementary level on April 17, 2001 respectively. An annex
            was opened on its eighth year of undertaking (AY 2008-2009) having
            86 pupils. Thereafter, renovations and additional facilities were
            constructed in order to accommodate the increasing number of pupils.
            Additional lots were also acquired for further expansion.

                  streets hazards and from violent laden society in other words,
                  accessibility to the school is favorable to the students. In
                  1999 with the expansion made in the said school, words of
                  encouragement to change the name of the school have been
                  raised by the parents concerned and staff as well. Thus, LWLC
                  is now named, St. Charles Augustine School of Biñan Laguna
                  Inc. with the approval of the Securities and Exchange
                  Commission (SEC) on May 2, 2002. St.Charles Augustine School
                  of Biñan Laguna Inc. is a non-sectarian institution owned by
                  Reynaldo/Millette Casunuran, it is non-profit, non-stock
                  institution situated at 170 Brgy. Timbao Biñan, Laguna.

                  The school started its operation in the school year 1995-1996
                  offering Pre-elementary education with barely 1 room with 15
                  pupils enrolled in Kinder. On second year, the school opened
                  complete Pre-elementary department Nursery, Kinder and
                  Preparatory respectively. The population grew to 30, an
                  indicator of community’s confidence with us. In the school
                  year 1997-1998 government recognition was granted by the DECS
                  for the Pre-Elementary May 21, 1997. When the Elementary level
                  (Grades 1-3) was opened, its population rose to 45. By the
                  school year 1998-1999 when the Elementary was opened (Grade
                  1-4) the student population became 65. On its fifth year
                  operation (1999-2000) the student population rose to 70. The
                  legal documentation for its registration was approved by the
                  DTI on September 16, 1999. Then in the school year 2000-2001
                  SCAS - Pre-elementary department became fully operational.
                  Government recognition was granted by the Department of
                  Education for the Elementary level on April 17, 2001
                  respectively. An annex was opened on its eighth year of
                  undertaking (AY 2008-2009) having 86 pupils. Thereafter,
                  renovations and additional facilities were constructed in
                  order to accommodate the increasing number of pupils.
                  Additional lots were also acquired for further expansion.
